Storage
=======

The storage backends will provide factories to create objects such as
ballots, elections, and so forth.  These objects can save and recall
from backend.

The backends will also provide classes to dig under the hood.  This
abstracts away identification.  For example:  the ICandidate
interface does not provide a unique identifier; the class
implementing ICandidate handles that.  When exporting from a storage
backend, such as to transfer ballots through a file, the application
will call on the storage backend to provide a unique identifier for
the class implementing ICandidate.
